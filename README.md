# Hash Table

This tiny project implemented for my [virtual machine](https://github.com/ambr0siaa/LunaVM). This needs for fast get instruction when translating source code of [lasm](https://github.com/ambr0siaa/LunaVM/blob/master/lasm/src/lasm.c). This file with name `ht`

File with name `table` are new version of _hashtable_. New table tested on [big file](t8.shakespeare.txt). And also I tested my _hash-function_ with diffrent keys.
